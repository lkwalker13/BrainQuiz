## Game conditions
After opening the application, the game will automatically start.
A 20 second timer starts. 2 random numbers appear on the screen and one of the three operations on them plus,minus or multiply.
Below them are four random answers, one of which is correct.You need to select one as fast as you can
If the player answers correctly, then the button is highlighted in green, otherwise, in red, there is also a counter of correct answers in the upper left corner.
At the end of the time, a new viewcontroller opens, which displays your progress and a button to play again.
I tried to write the whole application according to the MVC pattern.
